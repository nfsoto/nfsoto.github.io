This is a personal blog space for me to track the things I have  been learning.

The things I'm currently working on are as follows:
* How to draw by going through [Draw A Box](https://www.drawabox.com)
* Vim & Tmux (want to be able to use these in work)
* Improve my writing skills

I'll be updating this blog with updates on my drawing progress mainly and I hope to have some cool before and after progress eventually
